# Unity-Particle-Experiment
A short experiment I created in unity to test out 2d rocket ship movement and particle systems

### Controls
Left and right arrow keys rotate the ship. Up arrow key moves the ship in the direction
it's facing. 
Z will shoot a projectile

There are no enemies to shoot at so the projectiles were purely for testing different uses of the particle system.
